# Consensus
- [V] clean polling mechanism - generic promise with inner boolean predicate
- [V] node4 failed to start - header - typescript null !== undefined
- [V] 1 attempt failed
- [ ] node sync
- [V] NetworkMapping - node name ?
- [ ] Optimization:
    - [ ] Headers instead of blocks
    - [ ] caching - in blockUtils
