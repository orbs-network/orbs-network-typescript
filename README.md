# Orbs

This wrapper project will set up a full working environment including all sub projects. There is no need to clone every individual sub project, this repo is the only one you need.

## Installation

> Run when you want a fresh start. This will git clone all sub projects into `./projects`.

`./build.sh`

## Rebuild

> Run when you changed one of the sub projects and you want to rebuild all of them.

`./rebuild.sh`

## Run Simulation

> This will start a few services with some chatter

`./simulate.sh`
